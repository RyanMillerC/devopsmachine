## What is this

This is code for my own custom site I created with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). It is continously deployed through [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/RyanMillerC/devopsmachine) to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and is available [here](http://devopsmachine.com).
